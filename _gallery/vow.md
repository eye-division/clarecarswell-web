title: VOW
description_markdown: >-
   VOW was an installation made in a very beautiful 12th century chapel in Oxford called Bartlemas Chapel in May 1999. The chapel was once attached to a medieval leper hospital and over the centuries was used for marriages. It is still a consecrated church and monthly services are held there.

   The installation comprised several elements. The main image was a 'drawing' of a rose, made from dried rose petals. This was made on the floor of the chancel in front of the alter. On the seats in the chapel were placed simple black hand mirrors which the viewer could pick up and use for self-reflection. A sound recording played once a minute my own voice unaccompanied singing "When i fall in love it wil be forever" from the Nat King Cole song.  

   The chapel was very heavy with the scent of roses as I was adding rose oil to the petals daily for the week that the piece was installed.  

   This work VOW alludes to the sacred nature of the space and one of it's functions. It offers a timeless and enduring emblem of romantic love as a celebration of it as well as a reflection on the nature of the vow implicit within a marriage.
