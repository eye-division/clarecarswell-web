title: Fuel
description_markdown: >-
  Taking the composite photographic image FUEL as her starting point, the artist proceeds through action, drawing, sound and video to inhabit and animate her newly built work space and within it to develop an interactive performance work. The artist invites an audience into her studio as she works in an improvised way to test her work strategies and invstigate individual and collective responses to loss, the apparent necessity for the memorial, it's endurance culturally and historically, and contemporary re-workings of it that employ new technologies.

Cibachrome

A composite image of mourning and celebration. The hat worn by the artist to her Mother's funeral, is ringed by used birthday candles saved by her from the birthday cakes she made for her children as they grew. In a self portrait of Goya the artist is wearing a brimmed hat encircled with lit candles enabling him to go on painting once darkness had fallen. This image, borrowed and reworked here by Carswell, is offered as an image of hope, light prevailing over darkness, life over death."
