title: Performance / installation
description_markdown: >-
  *"I approached each opportunity to make the early larger scale performance works as an opportunity to make installation and I aimed to be acutely responsive to the space the work was seen in. Installations were made in the space constructed by objects left behind from the performance works. From the outset these residues were intended as installations and existed as such for a short time for the audience to move amongst after the performances had finished and left the performance space. Examples from performance works are included here to illustrate this."*   

  Examples are shown here of installations made as traces of some of the large scale performance works. The objects used in the performances were left in the space for the audience to view after the performances had ended.  

    The objects were : in AXIS - 30 stripped and illuminated globes, yoga mats and charcoal drawings of the eliptical shapes around the bellies of the pregnant women who performed the work, made by them as they left the space.  

  In CLOCK, twelve stacked black tables with the pink hair-ribbons the performers had worn were tied to the table legs. The word 'Mother' was written in chalk onto the tables, by the performers in their native tongues, as they finished the work and left the space.  

  In ENDLESS DEVOTION, 100 dinner plates were left, each holding an ice heart made from writing ink. By the end of the durational performance work these had melted.  

  In KIN an 8 foot high fountain was the remaining object in the performance space. No picture exists of this.
