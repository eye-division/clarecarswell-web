  Where it all began.  

  My training in printmaking instilled an attitude to making work that still underpins my practice, a strong sense of the necessity of process embodying image, that it must be more than illustrative. This persists whether I am making performance or drawing.  

  Then it was manifest in large scale dry points on steel or composite works, part sculpture, part print, often distressing and corroding plates and printing from rust, or dust from rooms where I had made things happen, swept and kept and suspended in extender.  

  Now I am interested in the immediacy of mono-print as a way of capturing the fleeting, the less contrived, and I find I Iike to go back to prints and draw into them.  

  I am about to start a period of work at the Oxford Printmakers Co-operative to make several new series of prints as I work towards a solo show next year.
