  YOURS is a durational solo performance work that uses interaction with the audience to explore memory, loss and our essential human need to remember.

  The work was made during a four day collaboration, METRON, with artist Alun Ward who showed a video and sound installation RUN.

  METRON Days Three and Four. Saturday 19th & Sunday 20th May 2007.

  Following the work MINE, performed on Days One and Two of the collaboration, the artist performed YOURS over a period of six hours on each of Days Three and Four.

  The work replayed the series of repetitive actions - crushing fresh rosemary in a stone pestle and mortar - that were made in the first performance work of the collaboration, MINE.

  In this work YOURS, the artist changed the relationship with the audience by conversing with them about the symbolism and intention of the work. She drew them in further by offering each a sprig of the herb as an invitation to remember and shared personal memories with them. She photographed the hands of the viewers holding their piece of rosemary.

  The work aims to invoke memory through the interaction with the audience and by scenting the space with the smell of crushed rosemary, symbol of remembrance. The actions and the sounds they produce are made in rhythm to the sound of foot-fall on the audio-track of RUN, a video installation by artist Alun Ward.
