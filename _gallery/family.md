title: FAMILY
description_markdown: >-
  Still from ‘Family’ Video Installation 2005  
  Duration 4 minutes.  

  A work which attempts to convey the profound sense of loss following a family bereavement and the comfort to be found in the familiarity of much loved objects within the home. A poignant glimpse at grief in old age, memory and echoes of childhood and family life remaining.
