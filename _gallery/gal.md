title: GAL
description_markdown: >-
  GAL is a series of works that included performance works PLAY IN / PLAYOUT, in the gallery and in rural parts of Oxfordshire and includes a durational performative drawing for the exhibition GIFT, with The Ideas Exchange, at the OVADA Gallery Oxford 5th April - 24th May 2008.

  GAL references and rethinks ethnic ritual and customs from English folklore that are connected to fertility. Drawing imagery from erotic medieval sculptures found in Oxfordshire as well as medieval literature the artist makes visual and gestural links both to selected locations in the region and contrasts contemporary with bawdy historic versions of the libidinous female.

  Visually seductive, inventive and comedic yet compelling, Carswellâ€™s work reflects the enquiry and vibrancy of the dialogue between artists in The Ideas Exchange.
