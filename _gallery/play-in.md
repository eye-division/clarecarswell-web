title: PLAY IN
description_markdown: >-
  Made as part of the GAL series of works, Clare performed for the first time as ME-WOMAN using improvisation and strategies of random play to perform a parallel series of actions as performance that both debunk and expose differing versions of the feminine. They embody the inventive and sometimes comedic dialogue between drawing and performative action that she created in a durational gallery based performance and installation, GAL for the exhibition GIFT with The Ideas Exchange at OVADA Gallery Oxford 4th April to 24th May 2008.
