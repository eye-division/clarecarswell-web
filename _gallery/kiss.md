title: KISS
description_markdown: >-
  Performed Museum of Modern Art Oxford  
  1998

  The artist performs with her 8 year old daughter Flossie Catling.  

  A choreographed series of gestures and actions between the woman and the child are performed to a soundtrack of mixed & sampled sounds of female singing voices, some from the sixties when the artist was the age her daughter is now, some contemporary.  
  The action takes place in front of large video projection of the performers faces. Some images are pixelated, hiding and then revealing their faces.  
  The work refers to the awareness and interchange of identity across generations whilst acknowledging the separation implicit in the act of loving. The interchange of gestures are finally shared with the audience. It echoes and  affirms the bond between mother and daughter.
