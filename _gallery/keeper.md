title: Keeper
description_markdown: >-
  *Keeper* took place in the streets of Charlbury in Oxfordshire and was part of the Festal Favours programme of performance and installation art for the Charlbury Festival. *Keeper* was a performance work that was integrated into another event, a tour of the lost shopfronts in the town by historic buildings consultant Jody O' Reilly. I worked with Jody prior to the event so I knew the buildings she was to speak about. She was enthusiastic about my adding a visual art element to her event and to proposing an alternative way of experiencing history.  

  My work was a conversational style immersion where I joined the walk and shared drawn images of items the shops would have sold with people on the walk. I invited people to pin labels of them onto me and to write on a shopping list that I wore.  

  Here I am with a resident who lives in a house that was one of two butchers, she has just hung a drawing of a sausage on her front door!  

  At the end of the walk I changed persona to performer and related to the folk on the walk as audience as I danced to *Hey Big Spender*.  

  From feedback I have had people were quizzical at the outset but enjoyed my cheerful and colourful presence in the event and appreciated the visual art contribution.

  Thanks to Stu Allsopp for photos
