  ECHO  
  2006  
  Solo performance, Leiden Netherlands  

  The artist was invited, as part of the celebration events for the 400th birthday of Rembrandt, to exhibit in the exhibition ‘They Came to See’ at the Hooglandse Kerk, Leiden Netherlands in July 2006.  

  A solo work, the performance piece took place in front of two blind-embossed prints made by the artist, hung on the wall behind her in the cathedral.  

  It used gesture and objects to reference Saskia, wife of Rembrandt and Hendrickje, his mistress. The work alluded to the conflict between a love described through devotion, repetitious acts and constancy and a passion that is hidden, unacknowledged but ultimately destructive.

  Duration 1 hour
