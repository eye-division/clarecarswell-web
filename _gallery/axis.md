  AXIS  
  Performed Serpentine Gallery London  
  1991  

  This work was performed by five heavily pregnant women and used the Serpentine Gallery as a physical instrument.  The women performed in the West Gallery, silently revealing the movements & gestures they used as active birth preparation for the birth of their babies. In contrast, in the East Gallery the audience were confronted by regimented rows of stripped, illuminated globes, a forlorn and pessimistic image.  

  These actions and objects described features of duality which are differentiated and reunited, coagulated and dissolved in the process of living.  

  The separate energies, that existed in the East & West galleries were in counterpoise, using the audience moving between the two as a fulcrum point.
