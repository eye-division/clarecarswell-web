title: ENDLESS DEVOTION
description_markdown: >-
  Performed Museum of Modern Art Oxford & The Serpentine Gallery London  
  1990  

  A mother & daughter face each other & attempt through repetitive gesture to communicate across a sea of objects. The objects, 100 dinner plates, act as sign of the domestic world, often inhabited by women & refers to the endless repetition of their touch and presence within it.  
  Each plate holds a heart shaped piece of ice which is frozen writing ink.  

  These objects act as  barrier between them & yet hold them united. The work explores the signs and language of contact & alienation. It refers to the unspoken association and devotion of mother & daughter, one to another.  

  The gestures made, intimate & personal to each, act as semaphores of identity & age whilst emphasising the distance between them. Their shared humanity is obscured by their inability to communicate. The work moves through a series of disjointed emotional postures to an understanding of their common tongue but the frailty of itâ€™s expression.  
  The frozen writing ink hearts melt throughout the piece.  

  Performed by Mary Robinson and Emma Puddy.

  Duration 1 hour 30 minutes
