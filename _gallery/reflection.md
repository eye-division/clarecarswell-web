title: REFLECTION
description_markdown: >-
  REFLECTION was an installed work made in St Peter's College Chapel in Oxford, July 2000 as part of OOMF, Oxfordshire's Own Millennium Festival.  
  189x41cm  
  Steel,etched and rusted, rust, salt, copper, sugar, blue geraniums.  

  The work echoed the dimensions of the stained glass window "In His hands the seeds will grow", by Ervin Bossanyi on the South Chancel wall behind the font. Through the making of this window in 1943, the artist made a statement of hope in a world of despair.  

  Just before his death in 1975, Bossanyi wrote : 
  >"Perhaps my lamp is not valid in a place like our modern world, so terribly full of neons, flood-reflectors, search-lights and atomic flashes. We have offered our modest contributions, a brick, a stained glass, a gesture, a sentence, a whole life's endeavour".  

  The work REFLECTION that I made for this chapel attempted to offer another image of hope and renewal for the start of the new millennium. Using simple materials, the piece described the transformation from despair and destruction to an image of beauty and life.  

  It alludes to the calling of St Peter as "a fisher of men" and as the ultimate symbol of repentence as a stepping stone to faith. It references Matthew 6: 25-34, where Christ challenges humankind to have faith in God, he who clothes the flowers in the fields.
