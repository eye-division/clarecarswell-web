  A selection of images from several series of photographs made infrequently and over a long period, between 1986 and 2006. Each image shown is one of several that make up a suite and when shown are exhibited as such.  

  They are powerful and arresting images and most definitely needed to be made as photographs. But rather like the drawings I make, they are not always shown. When they do they are rarely exhibited alone but alongside other works. Like my drawings, they exist for me as a rather mysterious prong of the armature of my work and thinking.  

  Before digital imaging was so easily available and affordable,  I worked with professional photographers to make my images, I would art direct the shoots and then have the photos hand printed for me. For the last few years I have artworked the images digitally myself. hence the shift to colour too. 

  I always employ professional printers to print the pictures.

    Black & white photograph  

    One of a series of images of objects from the world of the domestic, a world perhaps more traditionally regarded as female. They are combined to form images that allude to a longing for transendence and transformation."

    Black & White photograph  

    One of a suite of six pictures made & exhibited in Amsterdam. Depicting a woman's hands writing and then defacing both the text from a prayer, and herself, with chalk on a blackboard.  The work alluded to the bind of faith and of religious dogma and the conflicts often invoked in women by them."
