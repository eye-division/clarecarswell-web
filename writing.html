  <div class="editable">
<p>Writing plays an important role in the development of Clare's own work. Repetition of the spoken or sung word often features in her performance works.</p>
<p>She writes catalogue essays and reviews for the UK regional press and international art  journals. Some of her art writing can be read on her writing archive web-site <a href="http://www.seesee-write.com">www.seesee-write.com</a>. In spring 2016 she launched IRIS (&copy;  Clare Carswell), an online audio art review platform with colleagues in the US and Ireland. <a href="http://irisartinsights.tumblr.com">irisartinsights.tumblr.com</a></p>
<p>She is currently researching the first of a planned series of books, <em>'The Red Thread Series'</em><strong> </strong>(&copy;  Clare Carswell), which examines the imaginary dialogue between artists  living and dead, and explores the intellectual lineage of established  artists' works.</p>
<p>Clare writes poetry and is writing her first novel.&nbsp;<em><br />
